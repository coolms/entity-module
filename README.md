Platform composition over [`coolms/entity`](https://packagist.org/packages/coolms/entity):
the pieces that need a persistence implementation without naming one.

- `Serializer\ExtrasFlatteningNormalizer` -- lifts an entity's `$extras` bag onto
  the normalized top level and routes writes back into it, filtered by the
  instance-aware schema so a field scoped with `appliesTo` never leaks onto an
  instance it does not apply to. Types claimed through
  `ExtrasNormalizationExclusionInterface` are left alone.
- `TaggedRepositoryRegistry` / `Resolver\RepositoryEntityAliasResolver` --
  alias-to-repository lookup over the tagged repository set.
- `ReflectionFieldExtractor` / `Field\ReflectionEntityFieldDescriptor` --
  attribute-driven field description.
- `Widget\*` -- `entity:find` and `entity:findAll` renderers for coolms/dtmpl.

Requires the virtual package `coolms/entity-persistence-implementation`, which
`coolms/entity-doctrine` provides.

## Installation

```bash
composer require coolms/entity-module coolms/entity-doctrine
```

> **The adapter is part of the install, not a second step.** This package
> requires the virtual `coolms/entity-persistence-implementation`, and only an
> adapter provides it, so `composer require coolms/entity-module` on its own
> cannot resolve — Composer reports that the virtual package "could not be found
> in any version", which reads like a broken package rather than a missing
> argument.
>
> The hard failure is by design. The alternative is a platform that installs
> cleanly and then cannot persist anything. `coolms/entity-doctrine` is the
> adapter that exists today; substitute another if you write one.

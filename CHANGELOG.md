## 2.0.0-alpha1 - 2026-09-01

**A pre-release. It carries no compatibility promise**, which is the honest
statement of where the platform is: the shape is still moving, and a stable tag
would be a promise that cannot be kept yet.

Composer will not install it under default stability. Set

```json
"minimum-stability": "alpha",
"prefer-stable": true
```

in your root `composer.json`, then `composer require coolms/entity-module:^2.0`.
`prefer-stable` keeps every other dependency of yours on its newest stable
release, so this loosening applies to what actually needs it and nothing else.

⚠️ **A per-package flag is not enough here.** `composer require
coolms/entity-module:^2.0@alpha` admits the alpha of the package it names and
**nothing behind it**, so the siblings this one pulls in still fail to resolve.
Composer reports it against the sibling, not against what you asked for.

A bare `composer require coolms/entity-module` takes the newest **stable** release
instead -- which is the previous generation -- and reports success while doing
it.

Releases are suspended while development is moving fast and there are no
external consumers of these packages. This tag establishes the baseline the
documentation describes; nothing follows it until somebody outside the project
installs one, at which point the release policy resumes.

### Fixed: the installation command in the readme names the adapter

`composer require coolms/entity-module` on its own cannot resolve. This package
requires a virtual persistence-implementation package, and only an adapter
provides one, so Composer reports that the virtual package "could not be found
in any version" -- which reads like a broken package rather than a missing
argument.

The readme now leads with the command that works:
`composer require coolms/entity-module coolms/entity-doctrine`.

### Changed: sibling constraints move to the v2 generation

- `coolms/core`: `^1.0` to `^2.0`
- `coolms/entity`: `^1.0` to `^2.0`
- `coolms/entity-persistence-implementation`: `^1.0` to `^2.0`
- `coolms/entity-doctrine` (development): `^1.0` to `^2.0`

⚠️ **This is a minor, not a major, and that is deliberate.** This package
reached major 2 before the platform adopted a shared generation number, and it
did so while still requiring major 1 of its siblings. The v2 generation of those
siblings is **code-identical** to v1 -- their major moved to mark the
generation, not to break anything -- so nothing a caller can reach has changed
here.

**Upgrading:** if your own `composer.json` pins any of those packages at
`^1.0`, widen it to `^2.0`. Otherwise there is nothing to do.

The constraints on `coolms/dtmpl` and `coolms/rql` are unchanged. Those are
standalone libraries and do not take the platform generation.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-08-26

### Changed

Require `coolms/dtmpl` `^2.0`. DTMPL 2.0 encodes output by default and renamed
the verbatim block; a major here rather than a minor because moving a consumer
across that boundary is a break for them, whether or not this package's own API
moved.

Also added the CI, version, PHP and licence badges to the readme.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-18

First release. The platform composition layer over `coolms/entity`: reflection
field extraction, the tagged repository registry, the extras-flattening
normalizer, and the `entity:find` widget renderers.
